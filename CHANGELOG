1. Changed NetCTL to use "_" inbetween it's name and the name of the network when creating a profile, instead of "-", because of how systemd treats "-" as a special character.
2. Fixed a bug where every network was either "Open" or "WEP." It now correctly states "WPA" if that is what it is.
3. Fixed the column layout. Basically, "Connection Quality" listed the security type, and "Security Type" listed the connection quality.
4. Fixed the "Connected?" column to correctly state if you are connected to a network.
